# Sudaverse site conventions

Read this before touching any file. It is the contract between everyone working on the site.

## Stack and commands

Astro 7 + TypeScript, static output, React only for one island (`src/components/flow`). Node 22+.
The dev server is already running at http://localhost:4321 (hot reload). Do **not** start or stop it.
Validate with an isolated build: `cd site && ASTRO_OUT_DIR=/tmp/sv-<yourname> npx astro build` (never plain `npm run build`, other people share `dist/`). Optional: `npx astro check`.
Never commit, push, or edit files you do not own (see ownership in your brief).

## Routing and i18n (English + Arabic, RTL-ready)

- Every page lives at `src/pages/[lang]/...` and exports `getStaticPaths` returning `localeStaticPaths()` (from `@/i18n/utils`). `Astro.params.lang` is `'en' | 'ar'`.
- Dynamic routes return one entry per locale AND per item, e.g. `locales.flatMap(lang => items.map(item => ({ params: { lang, slug: item.slug }, props: { item } })))`.
- Page copy is written next to the page as a bilingual object and selected once:
  `const copy = { en: {...}, ar: {...} }[locale];`
  Shared strings come from `t(locale, key)` (`src/i18n/ui.ts`). Data modules use `Localized` fields and `pick(value, locale)`.
- Links: always `localePath(locale, 'products/terab')`; never hard-code `/en/`.
- Arabic is native MSA copy, not a mirror. Brand and product names stay Latin: wrap in `translate="no"`. Emails, code, URLs inside Arabic text get `dir="ltr"` on their own element.
- Use CSS logical properties only (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`, `inset-inline-start`, `text-align: start`, `border-inline-start`). No `left/right`, no `ml/mr`. Directional icons: `<Icon directional />` (mirrors in RTL).
- Layout wrapper: `import Base from '@/layouts/Base.astro'` with props `title`, `description` (both per locale, unique per page), `nav` (`'home'|'projects'|'research'|'about'|'contact'`), optional `jsonLd` (array of schema.org objects), `image`, `noChat`.

## Design system (tokens live in `src/styles/tokens.css`; use only these)

Never write raw hex. Use custom properties.

- Ground: `--color-bg` (paper), `--color-bg-alt` (paper-2), deep: `--color-bg-deep` (Nile 900). Text: `--color-text`, `--color-text-muted`, `--color-text-meta`; on deep: `--color-text-on-deep`, `--color-text-on-deep-muted`. Lines: `--color-border`, `--color-border-strong`.
- Actions: `--color-action` (Nile blue, primary), `--color-convert` (the logo's blue: "Talk to Us" only), links `--color-link`. Logo hues: `--brand-navy`, `--brand-blue(-600/-700)`, `--brand-green(-700)`; use the -600/-700 steps for text and fills.
- Accents: sage (`--sage-*`) = live/positive, copper (`--copper-*`) = the single warm "live thread" in art, Nile (`--nile-*`) = technical, logo blue = headline accent and conversion. Red only for errors (`--color-error`).
- Type (Schibsted Grotesk; Arabic pages switch to IBM Plex Sans Arabic automatically): sizes `--fs-100` (meta) `--fs-200` (small) `--fs-300` (body) `--fs-400` (lead) `--fs-500` (h3) `--fs-600` (h2) `--fs-700` (h1). Plain `h1..h4` are already styled; use `.t-lead`, `.t-small`, `.t-meta`, `.t-muted`. Mono only for code, data and repo names (`--font-mono`). Max body measure 66ch (`p` is already capped).
- Space: `--s-1`..`--s-10`, section rhythm `--section-y`, `--section-y-tight`.
- Shape: images and plates `--radius-1` (2px); inputs `--radius-2` (6px); popovers `--radius-3`; pills for buttons (the `Button` component is already pill-shaped, never restyle it) and small status chips (`--radius-pill`). Elevation: none, except popovers (`--shadow-pop`). Prefer hairline-ruled lists to boxes; no cards inside cards. **Glass is the one pinned exception** (owner request, 2026-09-21): frosted translucent panels are allowed only as the sticky header, the menu popovers, the chat popover and the two React Flow graphics (hero and pipeline). Use the `--glass-*` tokens or the `.glass` utility (never hand-written blur), only where a colour backdrop sits behind the panel, keep text at full contrast (never fade text with opacity), and never nest a `backdrop-filter` element inside another (the header's frosting is a pseudo-element for that reason). Content cards, forms and lists stay flat and hairline-ruled.
- Layout: `.container` (max 82rem), `.container--narrow`, `.section`, `.section--tight`, `.section--alt`, `.section--deep` (+ add class `on-deep` for focus/selection colors), `.grid-12`, `.cluster`, `.stack`. Breakpoints (media queries): 40rem, 48rem, 64rem, 80rem, mobile first.
- Motion: durations `--dur-1..4`, easing `--ease-out`. One authored moment per page, not scattered. Add `data-reveal` on below-the-fold blocks (scroll-linked, default-visible, disabled under reduced motion). Wrap every custom animation in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` or provide a reduce block.
- Components (all in `src/components`): `Button` (variants primary | convert | secondary | light | outline-deep; props href, arrow, size, external), `Icon` (arrow, external, menu, close, chevron, chat, check, mail), `StageBadge`, `TraceArt` (generative brand circuit-trace art: seed, tone nile|sage|deep, traces, leaves, graticule, thread), `LoomFigure`, `ProductPitch`, `Logo`. Look at `src/pages/[lang]/index.astro` for the established patterns: ruled lists (border-block-start/-end hairlines) instead of card grids, definition lists, deep bands, asymmetric grids.
- Role tokens (2026-09 design pass): components that need a role rather than a hue use `--color-brand-primary` (Nile 800), `--color-brand-secondary` (logo blue 600), `--color-accent` (logo green 700), `--color-surface` / `--color-surface-raised` (white: logo plates, cards, fields), `--color-bg-subtle`, `--color-success` / `--color-warning` / `--color-danger`. They point at the palette above; never add a hue to fill a role. Also `--radius-card` (6px), `--radius-media` (10px, screenshots), `--shadow-card-hover`, `--shadow-media`, `--stagger` (60ms between siblings, 4 to 5 at most).
- Family hues: `categoryHue` in `src/data/products.ts` (AI Products logo blue, Data & Insights logo green, Secure AI copper 300, Research & Language gold). Graphic only (dots, rules, constellation lines, menu icon tiles), never text.
- Product presentation (`src/components/products`):
  - `ProductLogo` is the only way to show a product logo: `size` card | hero | strip. It gives every mark the same optical area whatever its aspect ratio, never crops (`object-fit: contain`) and never draws a logo wider than its own pixels. A project without a logo gets its `TraceArt` plate (`art.ts`). Do not resize logos by hand anywhere else.
  - `ProductCard`: logo frame, name, stage, value line, audience; the name is the link and covers the card. Props `level` (3 | 4), `showCategory`, `compact`.
  - `ProductVisual`: the project hero visual. A real capture of the product's public page (`screen` in products.ts, only for a product with a public `url`) in a browser frame with the real host; otherwise the logo over the project's circuit art. Never a mock-up.
  - `FamilyStrip`: the four families with links to every project.
  - `CtaBand`: the deep closing band.
- Home (`src/components/home`): `ProjectUniverse` (the projects as a night sky: one constellation per family, one labelled star per project, a panel for the picked project; lights up once, still under reduced motion, a plain list without JavaScript; star positions are a map and stay the same in both languages) and `ResearchTeaser` (papers, latest artifact, public repositories, each with its real metadata).
- Project page modules (`src/pages/[lang]/projects/[slug].astro`) render only when their data exists: hero facts, problem and approach, capabilities, flow, research and resources (papers, artifacts, open-source code and directions linked to the project), get involved, related projects. Add material to `products.ts`, `research.ts` or an artifact's `projects` list, never to the page.

## React Flow pitfalls (learned the hard way)

The global reset sets `svg { max-width: 100% }` and React Flow marks nodes `pointer-events: none` when nothing is draggable. Any React Flow island must add `.yourroot svg { max-width: none }` and `.yourroot .react-flow__node { pointer-events: auto !important }`, otherwise the wires are invisible (zero-width edge layer) and switches or links inside nodes are unclickable. Also set `.yourroot .react-flow__pane { touch-action: auto }` when nothing pans or zooms, or a finger that starts on the diagram cannot scroll the page. Headless screenshots with `--virtual-time-budget` do not advance React Flow's post-measure frame, so wires can look missing when they are not; verify in a real browser session (a Chrome DevTools driver exists at the path named in your brief).

## Hard bans (brief + Impeccable + Taste)

No eyebrow/kicker label above a heading. No gradient text, glow, neon, colored `border-left/right` above 1px, hard offset shadows, nested cards, same-size icon-plus-heading-plus-text card grids, hero-metric templates, section numbers, emoji, unicode glyphs as icons (`→` `↗`: use `<Icon>`), stock-photo people, fake dashboards or screenshots, decorative gradients. No em dashes or en dashes in copy (use commas, colons, periods). No "cutting-edge, revolutionary, empowering, innovative, transformative, future of AI, unlock, leverage, seamless".

## Content integrity (public repository: everything committed is public)

Allowed facts: what is in `src/data/*`, `PRODUCT.md`, the previous site (kept under the git tag `legacy-static-site`) only where a brief explicitly permits it, and the public GitHub repos in `src/data/research.ts`.
Never invent or imply: customers, contracts, deployments, ministry or government relationships, funding, revenue, user counts, uptime, accuracy figures, awards, certifications, partnerships, case studies, testimonials, publications, datasets, models. Never write "TBD". If a fact is unknown, omit the sentence or section.
Never mention: products or names not in `src/data/products.ts`; anything the owner has put on hold (see `PRODUCT.md`); any technology stack, vendor, model name or hosting detail of a product; private URLs, hosts, repositories or credentials; scraping or social-data collection; the old third-party design credit. Stage labels must match `products.ts` (Live / In Development).
Partner and customer logos are omitted (relationships unverified). Legal pages (privacy, terms, security) do not exist: never link to them.

## Accessibility

One `h1` per page, ordered headings, each `section` has `aria-labelledby`, landmarks come from `Base` (`header`, `main#main`, `footer`). Touch targets at least 44px. Every image has meaningful `alt` (or `alt=""` if decorative). Forms: visible `<label>`, `aria-describedby` for hints, inline errors with `aria-live="polite"`, never placeholder-as-label. External links: `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` plus an `.sr-only` "(opens in a new tab)" using `t(locale,'a11y.external')`. Text contrast comes from tokens (all pairs verified AA). Under `prefers-reduced-motion` nothing may move.

## Images

Photography goes through `astro:assets` (`<Picture>`/`<Image>`) from `src/assets/`, with `widths`, `sizes`, `loading="lazy"` below the fold, explicit alt. The legacy photos are LOW resolution (about 700px wide): use them only in constrained frames, never full-bleed. Team portraits: consistent crop and tone (see Company brief). The Company hero uses an owner-supplied illustration (generated, with mock product screens); it must not be presented as the real team or real product screens (its alt text starts with "Illustration:"; the visible caption was removed at the owner's request, 2026-09-26). The R&D hero uses a cropped owner-supplied illustration (generated): the crop deliberately excludes the projected screen, which shows invented papers, journals and repositories with star counts. Never use the uncropped version: its papers, journals and repositories are invented.

## Contact contract

`/[lang]/contact/` accepts `?topic=product|institutional|research|data|integration|other` and `?product=<slug>` and pre-fills the topic and message. Anything that wants a conversation links there, e.g. `` `${localePath(locale,'contact')}?topic=product&product=terab` ``.

## Site structure (owner direction, 2026-09-26)

- Header: exactly three dropdowns, **Projects** (grouped by category), **Research** (Published papers, Artifacts, Directions) and **About** (Who we are, Mission and vision, Team). Same glass popover style.
- Home (owner direction, 2026-09-26): a corporate front door about services, sectors, values and how we work. It never names or lists products or projects (those live under Projects in the header). The hero graph wires capabilities into the sectors we serve (`src/components/hero/graph-data.ts`); the services band (`src/data/services.ts`, `#services`) sits directly under the hero.
- Diagrams: no visible pause button and no React Flow attribution badge (owner request, 2026-09-26). Autoplay still stops on hover, focus, off screen, in hidden tabs and under reduced motion.
- Every project page (`/projects/<slug>/`) follows the same four blocks: hero with logo, the problem and the approach, the animated user flow (`FlowDiagram`, data in `products.ts` `flow`), get involved.
- Research: `research/papers/` (publications in `src/data/research.ts`: two IEEE FITAT 2026 papers), `research/artifacts/` (MDX in `src/content/artifacts/`, see `ARTIFACTS.md`), `research/directions/` (six directions, `HierarchyFlow` map).
- Solutions, audience (`for/`), News and Resources pages were retired; their URLs redirect (`astro.config.mjs` and nginx).
- Artifact charts: numbers only from a cited source; colours only from `--chart-1..5`.

## Report format
